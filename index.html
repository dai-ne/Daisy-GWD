            <p class="caption">Axial is a design that is laid out on an axis or a line in a composition. 
                I made this design in such a way that the important dates are at the top to highlight 
                but not take away from the title itself ; to ensure that it doesn’t get lost in between the text as often.

            <img src="images/radial.png">
            <p class="caption">Radial Typography is when the elements are set out 
                 amongst the radius of the same centre. I designed it this way to have the title and 
                 paragraph to have contrasting colours to highlight the information seperately; to distinguish 
                 between the title(the attraction) and the smaller  details.         
                </p>

            <div class="typo-group">
            <img src="images/Dilatational.png">
            <p class="caption">
                Dilatational typography is text being aligned amongst a curve , similarly to the insides within
                a tree trunk.
                I didn't particularly like this design/style of typography as I found it hard to style to my own
                preferences and often got stuck on what I should add/apply to the design.

        <div class="typo-group">
            <img src="images/Random.png">
            <p class="caption">
                As the name suggests; random typography is drawn without aim 
                and can be often be unreadable due to its dysfunctional yet dynamic design. My design is 
                composed of both spikey and circular typography in patterns but not conforming to a certain style;
                the circles reminding me of a tornado and the spikes of stars.

        <div class="typo-group">
            <img src="images/Grid.png">
            <p class="caption">
                The Grid system consists of the page and its content being divided both vertically and 
                horizontally into columns and rows. I made it in a uniform sort of way; title, subheader of the paragraph,
                paragraph, then when and where and that it was free; it makes it very easy for readers/audiences to locate
                and skim through the content easily without losing the pieces of information that they'd want to remember.

        <div class="typo-group">
            <img src="images/modular.png">
            <p class="caption">
                The modular system is information/content broken up across
                the design ensuring the content is spread within shapes / designs. I found this
                system to be very tedious process to often be changing shapes, angles and colours within 
                both the shape and text, however it was to create a more dynamic and effective design.

        <div class="typo-group">
            <img src="images/Transitional.png">
            <p class="caption">
                Transitional typography design appears to be text that is layered and waves to create a 
                "transition" from one line to the other. I made my design in such a way to look like the waves
                of an ocean, with the last few lines sinking downwards; I found that i could not execute my idea futher with 
                the program as I found it difficult to attempt to have multiple layers of colour within each line.

        <div class="typo-group">
            <img src="images/Bilateral.png">
            <p class="caption">
                The bilateral design was the most simplest to do yet it was the least dynamic out of
                all of the different types of typographic systems;  symmetrical content on a vertical axis of the design.
                My design came out very "basic", as most would with the typographic system. I tried to draw more interest to it
                through having a bolder and dark contrast title and with smaller shapes breaking up the content between but it still looks
                quite basic in my own opinion.

        <div class="container-3">Overall, I found this project to be decently not the hardest
             but a learning curve that was interesting.
              I found it quite repetitive and didn’t quite like the restrictions of the project which was a challenge.
               especially as i sometimes found it to be frustrating to figure out how it worked as I was
                more so used to different programs and functions; often not seeing the small mistakes or having
            the shapes/text off centered. However in the end after thorough research, it became easier overtime
            as I gained more familiarity with the tools. 
        <br> Going back i would most probably adjust the sizing of each design and change colours/formats around again, and research further information
    into the program to see other ways I could achieve my ideal design.

        <div class="container-2">

            <div class="carp-group">
                <img src="carp/CARP.png">
                <p class="caption">
                    For this design I aimed to used radial typography within it and have it centering around the 
                    visual image; in which I took an image and altered it around in illustrator before adding it to the poster to create a visual
                    interesting element; with contrasting colours and shapes popping out to the audience, especially with the textboxes having a shadow
                    to make it visually more interactive.
                    <br>This poster would be my favourite out of the three posters as i really like the contrast 
                    and its dynamic composition. It took a lot more hours of work than the others as I tried new things and 
                    applied it to this poster such as the 3D font - which also was a bit too much for my laptop to run so I know its limits now when
                    it comes to design.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="carp-group">
                <img src="carp/CARP2.png">
                <p class="caption">
                    For this design, i wanted to lean more into the traditionally "girly" aspect of design; pink and a cute imagery. 
                    I chose the GRID system, placing all the time-scaled details on the top right, and address next to it so readers would 
                    have a clear idea of when and where it takes place; and that it is limited. The price ranges is placed at the very bottom with
                    the cat overlaying the text to create a more visually interactive poster and is bigger and bolder to highlight it; which now
                    that I think of it, it takes away too much focus from the entire purpose of the poster and could potientially drive
                    customers away with its high price; as the title on top isn't as bold nor as big as the prices so it wouldn't be the first
                    thing customers would see- but the cat is more visually eyecatching, so if i were to redo the design i would probably place
                    the cat on the title instead.

                <p class="caption">
                    For my third design, I went with the axial typographic system. I chose to have the title infront of the imagery so it would be
                    more in focus, and the information to go downwards and be on each side. I found that there was a bit of empty space on the top right
                    of the design so I added a shaped path of colour to add more vibrance and dynamic to the design itself. If I were to change anything I
                    would look into more fonts for this design to make it more interesting and a suited dynamic. I did like the image as I changed it
                    to be vibrant but it is not completely clear and does get a bit lost at first glance.

            </div>

            <div class="container-3">
                Overall, I did find this project rather very enjoyable without the restrictions and also quite challenging to come up with ideas of
                how the information will be framed around the image and how it affects the reading. In future I would probably have multiple versions of
                the same poster and use it in comparision to see which would look the best and be the most effective. I would also like to seek out
                more critisim from peers and tutors to see how I can improve before the final revision of each piece. In the end I think my posters
                have turned out quite well but could use some adjustments.

        <div class="container-3">

<p>Overall, this entire project was not entirely the most difficult in aspects that I was familar beforehand
    with aspects of html and as well as art/design programs from my own hobbies previously. 
    I never played around with CSS in particular, although I did hear of it beforehand, and it was very
    interesting to see how CSS essentially made styling html entirely a lot more easier. I was challenged with learning how CSS and HTML interacts
    often going back and forth, and as well with the flexboxes of the navigation bar as i wanted to be in a particular form, which I did achieve in the end.  
    
    <br>However if I were to change anything about the HTML I would look further into adding a interactive function where when you click
    each division/image, it would pop forward with the information, instead of just having it hover and scroll interaction.

    <br>For the Carp and typography, the most challenging thing was learning the program itself and coming up with individual designs-in which 
    I would personally say I have successfully done.  I enjoyed using different types of typographic systems and structuring them around my 
    images and seeing how it all turns out in the end whilst exploring the tools and the system of the programs.
